# geomdsim
A Python package to simulate brownian motion on different geometries and simulating the corresponding FCS experiment.

## Overview
This package can:
1. Generate trajectories in 2 different geometries: spherical and spherico-cylindrical (e.g in a bacillus shape)

2. Generate the a corresponding TIRF image

3. Process a simulated image stack as an FCS experiment.
